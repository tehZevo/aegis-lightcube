# Aegis Lightcube node

Based on https://github.com/tehZevo/lightcube

A recurrent, locally-connected, homeostatic spiking neural network using TensorFlow.

## TODO
* env vars
* separate repo for visualizing lightcubes
* add further tf ops (particularly, a replacement for view_as_windows would be nice)
* sparse add_potential?
* allow for arbitrary lattice and kernel sizes (ie not nd cubes)?
* add saving/loading models
